# SLTP Tipiṭaka

The SLTP Tipiṭaka was originally distributed from the website for the Journal
of Buddhist Ethics, however that site has been offline for over a decade.
Thankfully, archive.org has a copy of the original SLTP page at
https://web.archive.org/web/20100615203958/http://buddhistethics.org/palicanon.html
from which the original ZIP file containing a UTF-8 encoded, plain-text copy
of the Tipiṭaka can still be retrieved.  The files in this directory are the
unmodified contents of that ZIP file.

As noted on Access To Insight, the SLTP Tipiṭaka “is known to contain
transcription errors”.  The page on ATI about the SLTP Tipiṭaka has a short
list of errata, however I have made no changes to any part of the copy of the
SLTP Tipiṭaka hosted here.

The original SLTP page says: “[The SLTP Tipiṭaka] is freely available for
non-commercial purposes as public domain material under the terms of a GNU
license”.  No indication is given as to which specific license was intended,
